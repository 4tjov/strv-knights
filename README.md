# strv-knights
ERC-1155 multitoken smart contract for a medieval NFT Game. Each player will be represented as a Knight (knight is not a token). Knights can collect various gear, specifically: Armor, Sword, Shield. The gear should be considered as a non-fungible token.  Players will be able to “burn” a shield, which will give them an 80% chance of getting a sword but also a 20% chance of not getting anything (and losing that shield).  And as a proper starting NFT game, we want to allow public minting of up to 1,000 items.
